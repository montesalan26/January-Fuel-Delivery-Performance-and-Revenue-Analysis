# January-Fuel-Delivery-Performance-and-Revenue-Analysis

This analysis focuses on the operational performance and revenue trends for a fuel delivery company during the month of January. The dataset includes key metrics related to driver performance, delivery status, product types, customer information, and financial data. The goal is to assess the performance of drivers, the efficiency of deliveries, and to identify patterns in revenue and customer behavior. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), including correlation analysis, visualizations, and trend observations, we aim to uncover insights that can inform decision-making, improve delivery operations, and optimize revenue generation. Key areas of focus include driver fuel efficiency, load and unload times, delivery success rates, and revenue performance across different customers and product types.
